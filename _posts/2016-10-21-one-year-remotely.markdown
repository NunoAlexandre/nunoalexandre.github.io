In a blink, one year working remotely has passed. 

Since the first week of November 2015, I've been working remotly for Worth Internet Systems.
When I candidated myself to this position I didn't really know what to expect.
I was both confident and very nervous. Probably more nervous than confident.

Worth had people working remotly before but it didn' really go that well, and I had never worked remotly full-time before, thus we decided to give it a three month trial.

The fact that I was going to be the only guy working remotly became a factor of pressure for myself. Not from Worth's side but from my own. I guess I didn't feel comfortable with this special situation when compared to my colleagues. 

So when I started, and for quite some time, I felt vulnerable.
I felt bad that my team had to make the effort of preparing a video call (get speakers and some silence) to make the stadup possible for me. Also, the idea that I was pretty much in my room while that they had to get up and either cycle, get a bus or a train to get to work  

The schedule, the challenges, the good and bad things

The importance of routine

Early stand ups

Be trustworthy
