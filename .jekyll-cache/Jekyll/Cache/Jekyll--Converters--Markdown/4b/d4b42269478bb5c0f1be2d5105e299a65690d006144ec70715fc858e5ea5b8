I" <p>When programming we are using some programming language to describe a solution for a problem, to define behaviour or the flow of a computation. And we do it using a language that is not human, and itâ€™s not our mother language, therefore we inevitably feel the need to leave comments and make it as readable as possible. By other words, most of the times we comment to balance the unreadability of our code.</p>
