I"Û<p>In my spare time, I volunteer as the webmaster of A Rocha Portugal, an environmental organization based in Portugal and with branches all over the world. My first assignment, in 2012, was to build their new websites, using Wordpress. After almost 5 years of being promised a decent hosting at Bluehost, I finally got the time to find good alternatives. Here I share how I made their websites 20 times faster by moving to <a href="https://cloudways.com">Cloudways</a>.</p>
