I"<p>Sometimes we get to feel this desperate need of getting into the zone. We know how of a geniuses we are and we are fully conscious that if we are let in our own world and dive in to the zone, oh boy, it will be incredible!
Well… most of times it’s not true. I’m not confusing the preference for (enough) silence, a quite office and relaxed enviromnet with this need of getting into the zone.
The zone most of the times leads us to go off-scope, to write more and think less and to be more an individual than a teammate.</p>
