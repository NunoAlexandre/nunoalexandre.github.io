I"W<p><em>Delivering types from JSON like a Stork</em> is the tagline of my most recent pet project, <a href="https://github.com/NunoAlexandre/stork">Stork</a>.
Stork is a lightweight library written in Swift 4.2 focused on making the flight from JSON to Types as smooth as possible. 
Stork believes in simplicity, explicitness, and control.</p>
