I"k<p>Despite modern opinions, thinking that having no plan and merely living by the day is equivalent to freedom is a dangerous fallacy to hold on to. Freer is the man who chooses to walk from east to west than the man who happens to. Freer is the developer who takes the lead on their own journey than the one who is carried around like a bottle in the ocean.</p>
