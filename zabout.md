Writing code since 2010, I’m a passionate and enthusiast software developer aspiring software craftsmanship. I love to code and it really drives me to develop better software everyday. I keep developing myself by devouring books, blogs and talks from software craftsmen and by taking online courses. I take design patterns and principles as both science and art. I’m very interested in behaviour driven development and in functional programming.

I started to learn to code while on High School, both at school and on my own, and had my first real-world projects and work experience by then (from 16 to 18 years old).

Then I moved to university. Few months after I got a volunteering job opportunity as webmaster, that allowed me at the early times to make terrible code, what I find to have been a valuable lesson on what bad code can do. I now am more capable of offer better services to this NGO, A ROCHA, and it’s meaningful to help to protect the environment.

In the summer of 2014 – before my last year of bachelor  – I got a full-time position at Worth Internet Systems, in The Hague, where I was introduced to professional Agile Software Development, where I worked on the development of the Nieuwspoort mobile app – only available in The Netherlands. It was a tremendous experience by all means, including the friendships I still keep today with people I deeply like.

The last year was a true challenge, studying full time and keeping my volunteer work and a part-time remote position with Worth Systems. Without the need of ever pass a night without sleep, I was successful in finishing my studies and I’m now a BSc in Informatics Engineering. If you are a student in the same area my great advise is to not limit yourself to what’s given to you in the classroom but take it home and go deeper on things and you will see, independently of marks, how much more you will learn, grow and develop a critical thinking.

Now I’m working full-time remotely from Portugal to Worth Internet Systems with regular travels.
Aside from my job I keep a certain study discipline of few hours a week where I mostly read  interesting software engineering books and blogs, and do some kata sometimes.
As Uncle Bob Martin says on his book “The Clean Coder”, the 8h hours of work must be performance time rather than learning time; to practise and to learn must be our own duty and responsibility to do outside the work time.

On this blog I’ll be posting some snippets of interesting things I’ll read and learn around to both help me maintain them easily assessable and hopefully making them an useful resource to you.
