**Nuno Alexandre - 23 - Portugal**

Programming since 2010, I’m a passionate and enthusiast software developer aspiring software craftsmanship. I love to code and it really drives me to develop better software everyday. I keep developing myself by devouring books, blogs and talks from software craftsmen and by taking online courses. I take design patterns and principles as both science and art. I’m very interested in behaviour driven development and in functional programming.

I started to learn to code while on High School, both at school and on my own, and had my first real-world projects and work experience by then (from 16 to 18 years old).

In September 2011 I moved to university to study BSc Informatics Engineering. Few months later I got a volunteering job as webmaster, from where I took important lessons on how bad can rot. I now am more capable of offer better services to this NGO, A ROCHA, and it’s meaningful to help to protect the environment.

In the summer of 2014 – before my last year of bachelor – I got a full-time position at Worth Internet Systems, in The Hague, where I was introduced to professional Agile Software Development, where I worked on the development of the Nieuwspoort mobile app – only available in The Netherlands. It was a great experience by all means.

Studying full time while keeping my volunteer work and a part-time remote position with Worth Systems was great time management training, with no need of ever passing a sleeping night. 
 
If you are a student in the same area my great advise to you is to not limit yourself to what’s given to you in the classroom but take it home and go deeper on things and you will see, independently of the marks you get, how much more you will learn, grow and develop a critical thinking.

Now I’m working full-time remotely from Portugal to Worth Internet Systems with regular visits to their office.

Aside from my job I keep a certain study discipline of some hours a week where I keep learning.
As Uncle Bob Martin says on his book “The Clean Coder”, the 8h hours of work must be performance time rather than learning time; to practise and to learn must be our own duty and responsibility to do outside the work time.

I’ll be posting some snippets of interesting things I’ll read and learn around to both help me easily get back to them them and hopefully making them an useful resource to others.
